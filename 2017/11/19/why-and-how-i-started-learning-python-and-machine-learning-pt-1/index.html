<p>Python and ML together? PHP web development is my <strong>current day job</strong>, but I have
been looking into expanding my horizons for some time now. I would not dare to
say that I have done everything there is to do in Web/PHP, quite the opposite,
but having some <strong>extra toys to play with</strong> is always nice.</p>

<p>I also like the idea of <strong>different context</strong> - different technologies attract
different people, create different ecosystems and solve different problems.
These problems are what I am looking for - I am not interested in changing technology
I work with just for the sake of the technology - I want the <strong>new challenges</strong> that
come with it.</p>

<p>But again, why Python <strong><em>AND</em></strong> ML? I have always been inclined towards <strong>working with
data, processing information and giving it some meaning</strong> and since Machine Learning,
Deep learning, AI etc. are hot topics nowadays, it seemed natural for me to <strong>get involved more.</strong>
Additionally, high demand for these technologies translates into high demand for
skilled people, so it’s a practical, future-proof move to make.</p>

<p>I considered other <strong>alternatives</strong> for learning, like modern JS frameworks,
server-side JS, mobile applications and other, but all these seemed too close to what
I was doing already.</p>

<p>As for <strong>Python</strong> - it’s <strong>versatile, has a great community and wide selection of tools</strong>
in its ecosystem - I am not a hardcore Python fan <em>(yet?)</em>, but this was an obvious decision
for me.</p>

<h4 id="how">how</h4>

<p><strong>Python</strong> - I have been using Python for various small tasks for quite long, but I only started
looking into it properly last year (2016). Once I decided to get some more substantial
experience with it, I tried to find <strong>as much opportunities to use it as possible</strong>.
These include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Using it for <strong>deployment automation</strong> at work (<a href="http://www.fabfile.org">Fabric</a>)</li>
  <li>Having some fun solving <strong>programming puzzles</strong> at <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/m1n0">Codewars</a></li>
  <li>Using it at local <strong><a href="https://github.com/DEPOHurbanovo/exercises">code club</a></strong> that I run</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/petonagy/python_hackaton">Attending <strong>hackathon(s)</strong></a></li>
  <li>Investing some time and money into a bit more formalised and structured education,
i.e. taking <strong>online courses</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Machine Learning</strong> is a wide topic to learn, there are many different routes and approaches
one can take. I tried to create <strong>my own path</strong> that would suit my life practically, take my background
and previous education into account but also suit my learning style. I am a type of learner who
<strong>learns by doing</strong>, I don’t necessarily have to understand all the underlying concepts first,
too much focus on theory often reduces my interest in a topic -  some people call it <strong>bottom-up</strong> vs.
<strong>top-down</strong> approach.</p>

<p>I started with the famous
<strong><a href="http://coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning</a></strong> Coursera course taught by the ever famous <strong><a href="http://www.andrewng.org">Andrew Ng</a></strong>, but that was <strong>not the
best first contact</strong> with ML for me - I wanted to see what is ML capable of first, not solve
matrixes! I paused this course mid-way, and switched to Udemy for a <strong>very practical course</strong> (<a href="https://www.udemy.com/machinelearning">Machine Learning A-Z™: Hands-On Python &amp; R In Data Science</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/kirill_eremenko">Kirill Eremenko</a>),
that in return lacked a bit of theory in some parts, but provided good practical overview.
The <strong>combination of these two</strong> courses seemed like a good theory + practice introduction to ML combo to me,
a good foundation for further learning.</p>

<p>Next time I will go into detail of what <strong>online resources</strong> I use to learn both Python and ML
<strong>continually</strong>, to <strong>gradually</strong> gain required education and experience in order to become professionally productive.</p>

<p>What is your story? Do you have some good resources to recommend to fellow learners?</p>
