<section class='post-content'><p>It has been over a year since I decided to document my python/ML/Data Science learning path online a bit. A lot has happened in the meantime, especially in my personal life - which is why I was less active online in 2018.</p>

<p>In this part I will briefly go a bit deeper into what online resources I use to <strong>continually learn</strong> and apply my knowledge of Python, ML and Data Science in order to <strong>grow</strong> professionally.</p>

<h4 id="podcasts">podcasts</h4>

<p>I try to listen to podcasts as much as possible during driving, cleaning, walking and other activities that do not require my full concentration. I don’t have a definitive list of podcasts I listen to, but I rather pick specific episodes from different podcasts that catch my attention. Just search for “data science podcasts”, “machine learning podcasts” or “python podcasts” - there is a ton of them. Listening to these has been very useful for me to <strong>get to know the respective ecosystems</strong>, find out about <strong>popular libraries</strong> and techniques used.</p>

<p>Furthermore, they <strong>help with motivation and provide inspiration</strong> as they often feature beginners, or people like me, who transition from different backgrounds into python/ML/DS.</p>

<p><strong>Some</strong> of the podcasts I listen to include:<br />
- <a href="https://talkpython.fm">Talk Python To Me</a><br />
- <a href="https://dataskeptic.com/">Data Skeptic</a><br />
- <a href="https://www.superdatascience.com/podcast/">Super Data Science</a><br />
- <a href="https://twimlai.com/">TWiML&amp;AI</a><br />
- and more…</p>

<h4 id="twitter">twitter</h4>

<p>Twitter is a strange place, one can form it into almost any kind of social place they wish - so I use it primarily for learning python/ML/DS. It acts as a <strong>content curator</strong> for me, I <strong>get interesting articles, cheatsheets and tutorials</strong> from it. Sometimes I just read them, sometimes I act on them and try to replicate their content or use them as inspiration.</p>

<p>I also use LinkedIn in a similar fashion, but less frequently and a bit more randomly, but it can also be a source of similarly interesting content.</p>

<p>See my <a href="https://twitter.com/milan_lukac/following">Twitter profile</a> for a current list of who I follow.</p>

<p><em>edit: I added <strong>books</strong> and <strong>blog</strong> sections shortly after publishing this article:</em></p>

<h4 id="books">books</h4>

<p>I always have 2-3 books that I read at a time - and at least one of them is related to my profession. I am not much of a “learn by reading books” guy, so I utilize books in a different way - they serve me as a <strong>quick overview</strong> of something, or a detailed source for something very specific when needed. I often buy books in <strong>bundles</strong>, like Python or Big Data bundles from Packt on <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com">Humble Bundle</a>, which give me way too much to read - so I try to <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_reading">speed read</a></strong> through them, or simply <strong>skim</strong> them to get the <strong>most important ideas</strong>. This approach allows to maximize benefit with minimal effort - while still having the books at hand when more detailed info is needed.</p>

<h4 id="blog">blog</h4>

<p>This is an “opposite direction resource” - writing this blog is helping a ton to learn - I think everyone knows the <strong>“if you can’t explain it simply you don’t understand it”</strong> principle - it definitely applies here, I have to make sure I know what I write about, which forces me into deeper understanding.</p>

<p>Same principle applies to contributing to <a href="http://stackoverflow.com">StackOverflow</a>, but apart from an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/users/2209578/m1n0">occasional answer or vote here and there</a> I don’t participate in that community much for various reasons.</p>

<h4 id="kaggle">kaggle</h4>

<p>All the <strong>listening and reading would be useless without practice</strong> - and that is where <a href="https://kaggle.com">Kaggle</a> comes in. I only started using it actively very recently, and I already regret not doing so much earlier. Solving <strong>real-world</strong>(ish) challenges to get experience in ML is the best way to learn, as you <strong>get practice, feedback and discussion</strong> with others. I am looking forward to getting more out of this platform in the future.</p>

<h4 id="examples">examples</h4>

<p>All this is a bit vague, but all these sources combined have been a great help to keep the learning/exploring motivation up. Here is a <strong>short list of examples</strong>:<br />
- I learned about the existence of <strong><a href="https://dask.org">Dask</a></strong> because of Talk Python To Me podcast - and it’s on my “try and blog about” shortlist now.<br />
- I got to understand how <strong>important</strong> (historical) <strong>context and qualitative analysis</strong> is during the famous <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic">Titanic Kaggle challenge</a><br />
- I learned how to <strong><a href="https://would-you-survive-titanic.herokuapp.com">deploy ML models to a website</a></strong> when trying to publish my model for the same <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic">Titanic Kaggle challenge</a><br />
- I get constantly reminded that <a href="https://twitter.com/milan_lukac/status/1118463712183095296"><strong>ethics</strong> is a thing to keep in mind</a><br />
- I got hold of <a href="https://twitter.com/milan_lukac/status/1113000629121794048">great collection of <strong>DS cheatsheets</strong></a> which will surely decorate my wall when I land my first DS job<br />
- Quickly skimming through a <strong>Django</strong> book gave me an <strong>overview</strong> of the framework and it’s general principles.<br />
- Writing about building a simple classifier prediction model made me aware about a <strong>potential decrease in prediction accuracy</strong> when using <strong>one-hot-encoding</strong> technique for categorical data.</p>

<p>Do you have some <strong>useful resources</strong> you use? Please <strong>share</strong> them in the comments!<br />
As always, <strong>keep learning and having fun!</strong></p>
